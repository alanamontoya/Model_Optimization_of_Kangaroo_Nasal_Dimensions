# Model_Optimization_of_Kangaroo_Nasal_Dimensions

Summary:

*	Calculated the optimal line for predicting kangaroo nasal dimensions.
*	Implemented plain stochastic gradient descent in Python to find an optimal model through minimizing error. The gradient descent algorithm used a 0.0001 learning rate with a total of 1000 maximum number of iterations.
*	Interpreting the optimal model revealed an optimal intercept of 2.29 and an optimal gradient of 0.32.
